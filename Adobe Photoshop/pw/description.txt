As a web designer with no professional experience, I am a highly motivated individual who is eager to break into the field and start building my career. I have a strong passion for web design and am constantly learning new skills and staying up to date with the latest technologies and trends.

I have built a portfolio of personal projects and school assignments that showcases my design skills and knowledge of web development technologies. I am proficient in various design and development software such as Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and HTML/CSS.

I am eager to gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting and am open to starting in a junior or entry-level role. I am a quick learner and am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure the success of a project.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with a team of experienced professionals and to continue to grow and develop my skills as a web designer. I am confident that my enthusiasm and willingness to learn will make me a valuable asset to any organization.
