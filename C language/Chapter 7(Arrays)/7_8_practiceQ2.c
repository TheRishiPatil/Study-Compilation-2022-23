/* 2. If S[3] is a 1-D array of integers, then *(S+3) refers to the third element:
•	True
•	False
•	Depends

Ans ==> False
(If S[3] is a 1-D array of integers) <== these statement is for confuse
*(S+3) <== s[3]
Because ptr[0] points to the 1st element, ptr[1] points to the 2nd element, ptr[2] points to the 3rd element and ptr[3] points to the 4th element
